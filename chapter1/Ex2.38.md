#### Ex2.38:

The following is another proof of the arithmetic versus geometric mean inequality. The proof has a major weakness, which makes it incomplete 
in general. Describe this weakness and then define the restrictions on the theorem that are needed to make this proof correct.

Let $S = x_1, + x_2 + \dots +x_n$. To find a contradiction to the theorem, we need to exhibit $n$ numbers whose sum is $S$ and whose 
geometric mean is larger than $S/n$. It makes sense look for a set of numbers whose sum is $S$ and whose product is maximum overall such 
sets. In other words, we fix the sum ($S$) and try to maximize the product. Let <span>{</span>$x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$<span>}</span> be a set 
that maximizes the product, and whose sum is $S$. If $x_1 \neq x_2$, then we can replace both $x_1$, and $x_2$ with their average 
$(x_1 + x_2)/2$. The sum remains the same, but the product grows, because

$$x_1x_2 \leq (\frac{x_1+x_2}{2})^2 \tag{1}$$ 

with equality holding only if $x_1 = x_2$. If all the numbers are equal, then the theorem holds. 
Otherwise, this is a contradiction to the maximality assumption of the set.

#### Solution:

Firstly, the proof seems to focus solely on the set that maximizes the product. However, it should be noted that the contradiction in 
inequality $(2)$ holds for all sets, particularly the set maximizing the product over $n$ numbers while keeping $S$ constant.

$$\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n} <(x_1x_2 \dots x_n)^\frac{1}{n} \tag{2}$$

Continuing the proof, When replacing $x_1$ and $x_2$ with their average, to prove the product's growth, we cannot use $(1)$ since we 
assumed the contradiction of this equation to be true (equation 2). We establish the growth as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(x_1 - x_2)^2 &\geq 0 \\
x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 &\geq 0 \\
x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 &\geq 4x_1x_2 \\
\frac{x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2}{4} &\geq x_1x_2 \\
(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2})^2 &\geq x_1x_2 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

This implies the existence of another distinct set that maintains the sum while increasing the product, contradicting the assumed 
maximality of the original set.
