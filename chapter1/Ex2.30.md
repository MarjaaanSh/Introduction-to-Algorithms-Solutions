#### Ex2.30:


A complete binary tree is defined inductively as follows. A complete binary tree of height $O$ consists of $1$ node which is the root. A 
complete binary tree of height $h + 1$ consists of two complete binary trees of height $h$ whose roots are connected to a new root. Let $T$ 
be a complete binary tree of height $h$. The height of a node in $T$ is $h$ minus the node's distance from the root (e.g., the root has 
height $h$, whereas a leaf has height $0$). Prove that the sum of the heights of all the nodes in $T$ is $2^{h+1} - h - 2$.
