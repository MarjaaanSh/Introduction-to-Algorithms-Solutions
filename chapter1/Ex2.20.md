#### Ex2.20:
Prove that the regions formed by $n$ circles in the plane, each with one chord, can be colored with three colors such that any neighboring 
regions are colored differently.

#### Solution:
When adding another circle, two subregions are formed inside the circle. For one of these subregions, assuming we have three colors as 
$a, b, and c$, we change $a$ to $b$, $b$ to $c$, and $c$ to $a$. For the other subregion, we change each color to its previous one, 
transforming $a$ to $c$, $b$ to $a$, and $c$ to $b$. Now, if the inner part of a subregion shares a boundary with another region of a 
circle or an outside region, we change the inside color to its next or previous color. If two regions are on the two sides of the chord, 
then the color of one of the regions is changed to its next, and the other is changed to the previous one. This completes the proof.
