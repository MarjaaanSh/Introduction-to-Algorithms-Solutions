#### Ex2.7
Prove that there are two numbers in a set of $n+1$ numbers out of the first $2n$ natural numbers, one of which devides the other. 

#### Solution:

For $n = 1$, consider the set ${1, 2}$. Here, 1 divides 2, and the base case holds.


Inductive hypothesis: 

Assuming $n = k$, there exists two numbers in the set of $k + 1$ numbers out of the set ${1, 2, ..., 2k-1, 2k}$, where one of them divides the other. 

Inductive step:

Considering $n = k + 1$, we want to prove that there exists $a$ and $b$ in $A$, a set of $k + 2$ numbers from ${1, 2, ..., 2k, 2k+1, 2k+2}$, where a | b. 

There exists three cases:

1. $max(A) = 2k$, then based on the inductive hypothesis, the proof is complete. 

2. $max(A) > 2k $ and only one of the $2k+1$ or $2k+2$ are in $A$. Then if we remove them from $A$, we would have $B$ with $k$ numbers selected from $2k$ first integers. Thus, based on the inductive hypothesis, the proof is complete.

3. $max(A) > 2k$ and both $2k+1$ and $2k+2$ are in $A$. In this case, if $k+1$ is in $A$, because $k+1 | 2k + 2$, again the proof is complete. If it is not in $A$, then we remove $2k+2$ from $A$ and replace it with $k+1$, making another set, $B$. We will proove that there exists a and b in $B$, where $a|b$. If $b \neq n+1$, then since $a$ and $b$ are in $A$ and the proof is complete. If $b = n + 1$, then since $a | (n+1)$ and $(n+1) | (2n+2)$, then $a | (2n+2)$ and the proof is complete. It should be noted that $a$ could not be $n+1$ since the first number that it divides is $2n+2$ which is not in the set.

Thus, we proved the inductive hypothesis.
