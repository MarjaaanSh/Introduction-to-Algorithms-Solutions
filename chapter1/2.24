#### Ex2.23:

The lattice points in the plane are the points with integer coordinates. Let $P$ be a polygon that does not cross itself such that all of 
its vertices are lattice points (see Fig. 2.8). Let $p$ be the number of lattice points that are on the boundary of the polygon 
(including its vertices), and let q be the number of lattice points that are inside the polygon. Prove that the area of the polygon is:

$$p/2 +q -1$$
