#### Ex2.23:

The lattice points in the plane are the points with integer coordinates. Let $P$ be a polygon that does not cross itself such that all of 
its vertices are lattice points (see Fig. 2.8). Let $p$ be the number of lattice points that are on the boundary of the polygon 
(including its vertices), and let $q$ be the number of lattice points that are inside the polygon. Prove that the area of the polygon is:

$$p/2 + q - 1$$

#### Solution:

Initiate the proof with induction on $p$. Adding a point to the boundry involves incorporating half of a square, contributing $\frac{1}{2}$ 
to the area. Note that to add only one point, there must be two points on two edges of the square where the new point is added. On the 
other hand, substituting $p+1$ for $p$ in the formula increases it by $\frac{1}{2}$, as well, completing the induction on $p$. 

Next, perform induction on $q$. Increasing $q$ by $1$ implies transforming a point on the boundry (e.g. point A) to a point inside it, and 
making the nearest point outside the lattice (e.g. B) a boundry point. Connecting A to B introduces two triangles on the left and right of 
the line AB to the polygon's area. The common edge of these triangles is AB, and the other two edges conncect the nearest points to A, on 
both sides, to B. The heights of these triangles are both 1, and their common base is AB, also of length 1. Consequently, two extra triangle 
with the area of $\frac{1}{2}$ each are added, contributing a total of 1 to the area of the polygon. Moreover, it can be infered that adding 
$1$ to $q$ results in an increment of $1$ in the total area of the polygon. This completes the proof.
