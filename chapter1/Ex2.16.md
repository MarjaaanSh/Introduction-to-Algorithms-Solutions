#### Ex2.16:

Prove that at least one of the regions formed by $n\geq 3$ lines in a general position is a triangle.

#### Solution:

For $n \leq 3$ is trivial. 

Assume the claim holds true for $n$ lines, ensuring the existence of at least one triangle $T$ among the formed regions. Now, when adding the
$(n+1)^{th}$ line, since the lines are in general position, the new line will intersect with two existing lines that made traingle $T$,
forming a new triangle. This ensures that, even with the addition of the $(n+1)^{th}$ line, there is still at least one triangle among the
regions formed by the $n+1$ lines.
