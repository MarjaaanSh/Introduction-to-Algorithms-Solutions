#### Ex2.23:

The lattice points in the plane are the points with integer coordinates. Let $P$ be a polygon that does not cross itself such that all of 
its vertices are lattice points (see Fig. 2.8). Let $p$ be the number of lattice points that are on the boundary of the polygon 
(including its vertices), and let q be the number of lattice points that are inside the polygon. Prove that the area of the polygon is:

$$p/2 + q -1$$

#### Solution:

First consider induction on $p$, adding a point on the lattice means adding half of an square which has the $\frac{1}{2}$ of area. On the 
other hand, if we substitute $p+1$ instead of $p$ to the formula, this will be increased by $\frac{1}{2}$, as well. This completes the 
induction on $p$. 

Then, for induction on $q$, consider decreasing the q
