#### Ex2.19:

Prove that any region formed by $n$ circles in the plane can be colored with two colors such that neighboring regions have different colors.

#### Solution:

For $n = 1$, we already have two regions that can be colored with two different colors. Assuming it is true for $n-1$, when we add the $n^{th}$ region, we will reverse the color of the regions inside the new circle. If the inside regions are outside the circle, we did not change their valid coloring. If they are inside the circle, the coloring of inside regions was not the same, and we now just reversed the colors, so again, they are not the same.
